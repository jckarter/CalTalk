<p>iCal has built-in support for publishing and subscribing to calendars over a network. However, this
support usually requires either buying a .Mac subscription or setting up a WebDAV server. For small networks,
CalTalk simplifies iCal calendar sharing by sharing your iCal calendars right from
your own computer. CalTalk also lets you browse and subscribe to other CalTalk users' calendars similarly to how you
browse iTunes playlists and iPhoto albums. To get started using CalTalk on a network,
follow these steps:
<ol>
<li><a href="#step1">Install CalTalk on your computers</a></li>
<li><a href="#step2">Start CalTalk and subscribe to calendars</a></li>
<li><a href="#step3">Set a password to protect your calendars</a></li>
<li><a href="#step4">Share your own calendars</a></li>
<li><a href="#step5">Set CalTalk to start when you log in to your computer</a></li>
</ol>
<br/>
<ol class="gettingStartedSteps">
    <li><div id="step1" class="gettingStartedStepHeading">Install CalTalk on your computers</div>
	<p>CalTalk installs like most Mac software; open the disk image, drag CalTalk onto your hard drive or a public
	folder on your network, and you're good to go.</p>
    </li>
    <li><div id="step2" class="gettingStartedStepHeading">Start CalTalk and subscribe to calendars</div>
	<p>Launch CalTalk, and you will be greeted with the main window:<br />
	<img class="screenshot" src="networkTabScreenshot.png" /><br />
	The window has two tabs, the "Network" tab for browsing and subscribing to other people's calendars and
	the "My Calendars" tab for managing the sharing of your own calendars. When you first open CalTalk, the
	window will be open to the Network tab shown above. The names of all the users running CalTalk on your
	local network will appear in the left half of the window. Clicking a user's name will display their shared
	calendars in the right half, and double-clicking one of those calendars' names will subscribe to it in iCal.</p>
	<p>As an example, to subscribe to Bob's "Home" calendar, choose Bob's name from the Users list in the left
	half of the window (a), pick "Home" from the "Bob's Calendars" list in the right half (b), and click
	the "Subscribe" button (c). iCal will open to confirm the subscription:
	<span name="pantherOnly">
	    <img class="screenshot" src="iCal1.5SubscribeScreenshot.png" /><br />
	    Check the "Refresh every 15 minutes" box (d) so that iCal will keep the calendar up to date automatically,
	    then click the "Subscribe" button (e) to confirm. The calendar, named "Home (bob)", will now
	    appear in iCal's Calendars list:<br />
	    <img class="screenshot" src="iCal1.5CalendarsListScreenshot.png" /><br />
	</span>
	<span name="tigerOnly">
	    <img class="screenshot" src="iCal2.0SubscribeScreenshot1.png" /><br />
	    Click the "Subscribe" button (d) to confirm. Another sheet will appear:<br />
	    <img class="screenshot" src="iCal2.0SubscribeScreenshot2.png" /><br />
	    Give the calendar a descriptive name (e), such as "Bob's Home", and check the "Refresh 
	    every 15 minutes" box (f) so that iCal will keep the calendar up to date automatically. Press "OK" (g),
	    and the "Bob's Home" calendar will appear in iCal's Calendars list:<br />
	    <img class="screenshot" src="iCal2.0CalendarsListScreenshot.png" /><br />
	</span>
	Repeat for every calendar you want to subscribe to. If a user has put a password on their calendars, you will
	be prompted for that password before listing or subscribing to them.
	</p>
    </li>
    <li><div id="step3" class="gettingStartedStepHeading">Set a password to protect your calendars</div>
	<p>If you do not want to share your own calendars, you're done! None of the following steps are
	necessary just to browse with CalTalk.</p>
	<p>To limit access to your shared calendars on the network, you may want to require a password to access
	them. A "Set Password" button is provided under the "My Calendars" tab for this purpose:<br />
	<img class="screenshot" src="myCalendarsSetPasswordScreenshot.png" /><br />
	Press the button, and you will be taken to the Security section of CalTalk's preferences:<br />
	<img class="screenshot" src="preferencesSecurityScreenshot.png" /><br />
	Type your user name into the "User name" box (a), then type your password twice into the two "Password" boxes
	(b). After this is done, press the "Set Name and Password" button (c). A lock icon will appear to indicate
	that your password has been successfully set (d). Note that the contents of the password boxes may appear to
	change as soon as you press the "Set Name and Password" button; to protect your password, CalTalk replaces the
	boxes' contents with a random string as soon as it has been saved.</p>
	<p>Once your password has been set, you will need to decide whether you want to protect your calendars using
	digest authentication. Digest authentication provides added security by encrypting your password when it is
	sent over the network; unfortunately, the version of iCal included with MacOS 10.3 "Panther" cannot subscribe
	to calendars protected with digest authentication. If all of the computers you will be sharing calendars with
	are using MacOS 10.4 "Tiger" or higher, make sure the "Use Digest authentication" checkbox (e) is checked.
	If you have to maintain compatibility with machines running Panther, uncheck the box. Be aware that if other
	users on your network snoop on your network traffic, they will be able to read your password.</p>
    </li>
    <li><div id="step4" class="gettingStartedStepHeading">Share your own calendars</div>
	<p>To make your own calendars available on the network, go to the main window's "My Calendars" tab:<br />
	<img class="screenshot" src="myCalendarsTabScreenshot.png" /><br />
	Check the "Share my calendars" box (a) to start sharing your calendars, then check the boxes next to the
	names of your calendars (b) that you want to make public. Your name and calendars will now appear for other
	CalTalk users to browse and subscribe to. Note that <b>you must leave CalTalk running</b> for other users 
	to continue to be able to see your calendars. You may close the CalTalk window while sharing calendars;
	CalTalk will remain running in the background until you choose the "Quit CalTalk" menu item from the CalTalk
	menu. To open the Calendars window again after it has been closed, click on CalTalk's dock icon.
	</p>
    </li>
    <li><div id="step5" class="gettingStartedStepHeading">Set CalTalk to start when you log in to your computer</div>
	<p>If you share your calendars with CalTalk, you'll want it to run every time you log into your computer
	so that other users can	subscribe to your calendars and keep them up to date. Choose "Preferences" from
	the "CalTalk" menu, go to the "Launch/Quit" tab (a), and check the "Start CalTalk when I log in" box (b):<br />
	<img class="screenshot" src="preferencesLaunchQuitScreenshot.png" /><br />
	The setting will immediately take effect; there is no need to click an "OK" or "Apply" button.
