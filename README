CalTalk is a small MacOS X app I wrote to enable local iCal calendar sharing
over Bonjour for a small company. It has a builtin WebDAV server that serves
calendars out of iCal 1.0 and 2.0's private storage, advertising itself over
Bonjour so that other CalTalks can see it. It would probably need
substantial modification to work with contemporary versions of iCal. BusyMac
makes a product, BusySync, which works with modern OS X and CalTalk:

You may do whatever you want with this source code.
